So I ran the fuzzer on some reasonably variable cases for approximately 3 hours. In this time,
it got around 30 crashes, and 7 hangs. None of these were replicable at all.
This is of course after an overnight 12 hour run that got absolutely nothing, because
I ran it incorrectly as I didn't realize I had to add the 1 to the parameters.

I fixed two additional potential go-over-array issues in the animation function, but the files don't crash, they just go over in a way that in theory could cause a segmentation fault, 
but doesn't.
