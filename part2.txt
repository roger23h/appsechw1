Crash1 - weird symbols get read in as negative numbers, which results in a negative malloc.
Trying to get literally anything in a negative malloc crashes the program.

Further crashes: I can get the reg array in anim to go over the limit, by passing it an argument
larger than This however does not
acctually crash everything. I fixed this despite that, which hopefully counts for something.
I attempted:
 - negative gift card size. Unfortunately, putting symbols in with normal characters 
 worked for the first crash, and for here, and nowhere else. It didn't crash though.
  - I tried making the amount negative. Symbols didn't work, negative signs didn't work,
  two's complement didn't work.
  - I tried making a message length zero, I tried making it long. Neither of those did anything.
  - I tried making animations go backwords forever; once again ran into the impossibility
  of negative numbers.
  - crying for several hours. This worked, but crashed me instead of the program.
  - asking for help, which did help, but not enough.
